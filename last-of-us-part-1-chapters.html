Each chapter is broken up into a number of different sections, and chapters can be revisited upon completion in Chapter Select.</p><p><h6 class="mb-xs text-left heading-6">More like this</h6></p><p>The game's story takes place over a year and is therefore split into four seasons, starting in summer and changing every few chapters until we reach spring. You'll notice the weather change throughout the game from bright sunlight to autumn colours and back again, with a snowstorm even affecting gameplay in the winter section.</p><p>Seasons can't be selected to replay, however - you'll have to choose a corresponding chapter instead.</p><h2 id=the-last-of-us-part-1-chapter-list-37d4e055><strong>The Last of Us Part 1 chapter list</strong></h2><p>Chapters vary in length - the prologue and epilogue are particularly short - and they also cannot be skipped, so you'll have to take the long way around to find the fireflies. The Left Behind expansion can be played at any time, though it is recommended that you complete the game first to better understand the context.</p><p>There is also Chapter Select in case you miss any of those all-important collectables and are hoping to unlock all of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Last of Us Part 1 trophies</a> - just make sure to manually save first!</p><p>The chapter names aren't overly <strong>spoilery</strong> but do hint at the story direction, so the few people yet to finish this game may want to <strong>look away now</strong>. Here is the full chapter list for The Last of Us Part 1 and their corresponding seasons:</p><li><strong>Hometown</strong></li><li><strong>Quarantine Zone (Summer)</strong></li><li><strong>The Outskirts (Summer)</strong></li><li><strong>Bill's Town (Summer)</strong></li><li><strong>Pittsburgh (Summer)</strong></li><li><strong>The Suburbs (Autumn)</strong></li><li><strong>Tommy's Dam (Autumn)</strong></li><li><strong>The University (Autumn)</strong></li><li><strong>Lakeside Resort (Winter)</strong></li><li><strong>Bus Depot (Spring)</strong></li><li><strong>The Firefly Lab (Spring)</strong></li><li><strong>Jackson (Spring)</strong></li><p>There is also the Left Behind DLC, which came out after the game's initial release — you'll find it as an extra option on the game's main menu. We'd recommend playing this after you've played the full game, even though some of it is a flashback.</p><p><strong>Read more on The Last of Us:</strong></p><p><strong>Hungry for more gaming?
