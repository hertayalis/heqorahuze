He shared on his podcast, The Squeeze, that he even had to fight to keep that role for the next movie, saying that they were going to recast someone older to account for Jacobâ€™s transformation in New Moon. Lautner worked out religiously between filming so that he could exemplify the buff twenty-something that they were trying to achieve in the second movie.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Jacob, and all of the werewolves in Forks, Washington, were canonically meant to be part of of real-life Quileute Nation, which is native to La Push, Washington, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Screenrant</a>. The Quileute people are a very much present group of about 2,000 Native Americans whose culture, history, and existence were heavily featured throughout both the Twilight movies and books, much to the chagrin of actual Quileute people.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@1magnia href=#>@1magnia</a><p>Replying to @ðŸ–¤AngelinaðŸ–¤ <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> Just trying educate, pls dont get offended <a title=taylorlautner href=#>#taylorlautner</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=nativeamerican href=#>#nativeamerican</a> <a title=twilight href=#>#twilight</a> <a title=potawatomi href=#>#potawatomi</a> <a title=ottawa href=#>#ottawa</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Sami" href=#>â™¬ original sound â€“ Sami</a></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Despite playing a member of the Quileute tribe, Taylor Lautner himself has no recent Native American genealogy.
