Buckle up because it's quite the ride…</p><h2><strong>Why did Hailey fall out with Selena Gomez?</strong></h2><p id=eT6D05i5S38 data-wc=63>Their feud kicked off in January when Hailey, 26, posted a TikTok of herself and a bunch of pals lip-syncing to the popular sound 'And I'm not saying she deserved it, but God's timing is always right.' Fans were quick to assume that Hailey was subtly throwing shade at Selena who, at the time, had been subject to cruel comments about her body.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Selena Gomez, Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner drama explained</figure><p id=eippI9zms0s data-wc=26>Despite the apparent jab, Selena kept a cool head.

Because honestly, I don't believe in shaming people for [their] body or anything."</p><h2>Did Hailey make fun of Selena's eyebrows?</h2><p id=e9A03I-g39c data-wc=47>In February, Selena posted a TikTok poking fun at her over-laminated eyebrows. Just hours later, Hailey seemingly made a dig at Selena by posting a screenshot of herself FaceTiming <a class=hm-link href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>. In the screenshot, both Kylie and Hailey could be seen showing off their perfectly groomed eyebrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f253b58d17bb-hailey-bieber-brown-dress.jpg><p id=eRMCbDVKxpq data-wc=50>When fan comments started to get out of hand, Kylie was quick to shut down the rumours. Reacting to a speculative post, she commented: "<strong>This is reaching. No shade towards Selena ever and I didn't see her eyebrow posts! U guys are making something out of nothing.

I'm a fan of Kylie."</p><h2>When did Selena break her silence?</h2><p id=eL3pTbjCyOP data-wc=41>Towards the end of February, Selena finally broke her silence. Taking part in a TikTok Live, she exclaimed: "<strong>I'm gonna be taking a second from social media because this is a little silly and I'm 30. I'm too old for this.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a3ee8366ec9-selena-gomez-red-outfit.jpg><p id=ebJgcCRpZ9Wd data-wc=27>"But I love you guys so much and I will see you guys sooner than later.

In the video – which was shared by PopFaction – Hailey was captured on stage gagging at the mention of <a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift's</a> name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4ecb1480e7a2-selena-taylor.jpg><p id=ecgNkbCcc2HC data-wc=44>In a bid to defend her best friend, Selena made her feelings known in the comments section. Defending the 'Anti-Hero' songstress, Selena wrote: "So sorry, my best friend is my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game."</p><h2>Hailey's alleged Instagram dig</h2><p id=eccYvPgFcBNc data-wc=53>On 27 February, Hailey posted a video promoting her <a class=hm-link href=#>Rhode</a> beauty products along with a solo version of 'Calm Down' by Rema. The chart-topping song is in fact a collaboration between Rema and Selena Gomez, suggesting that Hailey's song choice was a subtle, yet deliberate dig at the actress.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What did Justin Bieber's party favors say?</strong></h2><p id=eqP7bMYeErKV data-wc=34>Whilst <a class=hm-link href=#>Justin Bieber</a> is currently married to Hailey, he enjoyed an <a class=hm-link href=#>on-and-off relationship</a> with Selena between 2010 and 2018. The former lovebirds started dating as teens, before making their relationship official in February 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a56ff0b890c-selena-justin.jpg><p id=eSiXMdY8hI3S data-wc=33>Justin Bieber legally married Hailey Baldwin (now Bieber) in 2018, although the couple kept the details of their <a class=hm-link href=#>marriage</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>very private.

His party favors raised a few eyebrows, with several eagle-eyed fans drawing attention to the message engraved on the boot-shaped lighter. It read: "<strong>I'm so thankful I didn't end up with what I thought I wanted</strong>." A mere coincidence? Who knows…</p><h2>Is Selena still friends with Hailey?</h2><p id=er68zk7BWlxE data-wc=53>Towards the end of March, Selena and Hailey appeared to put their alleged feud behind them. Hinting at a <a class=hm-link href=#>reconciliation</a>, Selena took to her Instagram Stories with a poignant message. She penned: "Hailey Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving death threats and such hateful negativity."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/204b7bdc7c3e-selena-gomez-headshot.jpg><p id=eIuKHJaE87PS data-wc=33>Pleading with her followers, she continued: "<strong>This isn't what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I've always advocated for kindness and really want this to all stop</strong>."</p><p id=eabNMOoNQOu9 data-wc=46>Hailey subsequently shared her side of the story. In a message posted to Instagram Stories, she wrote: "I want to thank Selena for speaking out, as her and I have been discussing the last few weeks how to move past this narrative between her and I.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1eda41f6d821-hailey-bieber-pink-suit.jpg><p id=ejT8NlefMAnv data-wc=50>"The last few weeks have been very hard for everyone involved and millions of people are seeing so much hate around this which is extremely harmful.
