Details on his job, and his Michigan background.</h2><p>The 23-year-old islander, who meditates at the villa's treehouse each morning, works as a personal trainer, and as a bartender. Chad hails from Michigan (he was born in Clarkson, but he currently resides in Kalamazoo).</p><p>He also attended college in his home state. Chad graduated from Western Michigan University, where he obtained a degree in Communication. He also minored in Mathematics.</p><p>His Michigan roots explain some of his connection to Phoebe, who is currently a student at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Though one of the perks of appearing on any Love Island series is social media fame, it does not appear as if Chad has a public Instagram feed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Chad decide to couple up with Courtney, Phoebe, or Mackenzie?</h2><p>Many of the current Season 4 islanders, like Timmy Pandolfi and Zeta Morrison and Jesse Bray and Deb Chubb, are settled in their couples.</p><p>There are, however, two wildcards who will have tough decisions to make during the Aug. 19 recoupling: Chad and post-Casa Bombshell arrival, Joel Bierwert. The latter islander is deciding whether he wants to select Phoebe or Courtney, while Chad also isn't sure whether he will stick with Courtney, pursue Phoebe, or take a chance with Mackenzie (who has made her intentions known that she is focused only on Chad).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Peacock</span></figure><p>According to his Love Island USA bio, Chad's celebrity crush is The White Lotus and Euphoria actress Sydney Sweeney — so could fellow blonde Mackenzie be the one he ultimately decides to couple up with?
