Nine new episodes saw our heroes trotting Xadia, exploring the seas, hanging out in libraries — basic dragon stuff.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>More to the point, season five of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dragon Prince</a> brought viewers more of Terrestrius, the talkative elf with a penchant for Earth magic and a welcome positive inside perspective on trans representation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Terry was first introduced back in the season four premiere “Rebirthday,” and has been played by fresh-faced voice actor Benjamin Callins.</p><p data-characters=660 data-current-count=1019 data-injectable=true>If you recognize that name, you might just be mistaken. Callins is exceptionally new to the scene, with a whopping three IMDb credits to his name, including a short independent cartoon called Cyclone and an even shorter independent cartoon titled The Curse. Those aside, the 22-year-old Canadian maintains a solid following on his YouTube channel, where he occasionally releases covers of popular songs from movie musicals. Particularly popular, his take on “Drift Away” from Steven Universe has around half a million views and, predictably, is going to get some stuff in your eye if you watch it. Not tears, just stuff. You probably have allergies is all.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Parties interested in following Callins as his star continues to rise can catch him on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, where his cat recently posed for a photo that made it look like he was taking a selfie, which was cute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZK%2BnmZiybq3CraarZaChrrq%2FjK2cq6qpYravedOhnGacopa0sLqMqamippOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
