Pineapple seems to be an indicator of "it's complicated." Why pineapple? The answer to that is unclear. Cherries in reference to a coupling seems more natural because the current emoji features a pair, but as for the meaning behind the rest, no one knows for sure.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This isn't the first time emojis have held hidden meanings on Snapchat.</h2><p>Following the fruit emoji trend, after a sneaky leak to Reddit, Snapchat users decided to update the code to include more emojis, like candy bars, numbers, colors, and finally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">animal emojis.</a> As if things couldn't possibly get more confusing, check out the new and improved list of relationship status meanings below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Romper</a> reporter Jenn Rose, who consulted with various teens on the issue, these emojis could indicate relationship status or how long the user has been in a relationship.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A whale means "it's complicated," and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>so does a monkey</a>.</li><li>A panda or a horse means single.&nbsp;</li><li>A bird means the user likes someone or wants to marry their partner.</li><li>A lion also means the user likes someone.&nbsp;</li><li>A cow means "taken" or possibly in a relationship for one year.</li><li>A cat also means "taken" at least for a few days.</li><li>A pig could mean "talking to someone," or having been in a relationship for a few months, or "No one is cute at my school," which is way harsh.</li><li>A rabbit means they've been in a relationship for a month, or that they can't find "the one."</li></ul><p>Ultimately, it seems like putting an emoji in your Snapchat story is meant to be deceiving... so err on the side of caution.
