Before landing the part of troubled drug addict Toby in the critically-acclaimed film, he was best known as the human sidekick of a canine star.</p><p id=ef_LU38IWjye data-wc=30>In the <i>Air Bud</i> series, the young performer was teamed up with a Golden Retriever whose talent for basketball, baseball and soccer would leave most professional athletes feeling rather inadequate.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeAqJxsnm-v data-wc=28>After four outings in the role, however, Kevin was left hungering for something a little more challenging. "I just didn't want to do another animal movie," he admits.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXRwbdUsIa data-wc=47>"<i>Transamerica</i> is the first film where I was really able to put one hundred per cent of myself into my work. The role enabled me to finally be seen as an adult actor and to break away from the stereotype that had been created for young actors."&nbsp;</p><p id=ehF-SQcgCOs data-wc=47>The teenage street hustler he plays in the movie is also in marked contrast to the kind of person Kevin is in reality. An impassioned sports fan, he plays hockey in Jerry Bruckheimer's celebrity league - when he's not busy with golf or American Football, that is.&nbsp;</p><p id=evyXgBIsrT data-wc=58>And the chisel-jawed performer is also aware that keeping fit is only one half of looking good. "I have 15 pairs of jeans and 30 pairs of shoes," he confessed to one teenage glossy. "I'm a total metrosexual!" So it would be fair to say that Ziggy, as his friends know him, is nothing if not an achiever.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-YPCbPzlx data-wc=23>He has also starred in a slew of hit TV shows including the likes of and .&nbsp;</p><h2>His early life</h2><p id=e-gK268AND data-wc=50>Born in the Canadian town of Woodstock, Ontario, on September 19 1984, he made his acting debut at the age of just six in a television commercial. In the years that followed he would appear in over 30 publicity clips, before moving to Toronto to concentrate on big screen work.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2wTI1WOjk data-wc=57>Having notched up over 20 film credits before his 20th birthday, the former child star is now ready to make his mark as a serious character actor. But while critical acclaim and the interest of major studios is, of course, very welcome, the budding performer is determined not to let his newfound recognition go to his head.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-4iaL-JcN data-wc=60>He says his former girlfriend, <i>Boston Legal</i> star Marisa Coughlan, helped him keep both feet planted firmly on the ground. Fittingly enough, the two performers weren't in a position to take themselves too seriously when they first met, as they were both wearing bizarre outfits for a mutual friend's Halloween party. "A friend of ours set us up," he recalls.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMdISuZQ7rG data-wc=65>"I came dressed as a painting and Marisa showed up in a cowgirl costume." The road ahead will inevitably mean getting used to A-list company, though. After signing up for the romantic comedy <i>It's A Boy Girl Thing</i>, which was produced by fellow Canadian David Furnish, the young actor found himself staying in the ubiquitous celeb's home with him and his partner Sir Elton John.&nbsp;</p><p id=e74Cl041MJH data-wc=40>But the 5ft 9in star, who once confessed that "being friends with cool people" was one of the things he liked about acting, says the film which catapulted him into the major league has also changed his perspective on things.&nbsp;</p><p id=edz0_O0z9U data-wc=63>Working closely with <i>Desperate Housewives</i> star Felicity Huffman, who garnered a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for her performance in the flick, made him realise that showbiz parties and social status were not what really mattered. "She works really, really, really hard," he explains. "Getting to watch her up close was great for me - I take acting much more seriously now."</p><h2>His personal life</h2><p id=ebn9J1QdCA data-wc=19>Kevin married talent agent, Jaime Feld, in August 2013. They went on to welcome twin girls in August 2015.&nbsp;</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9vb2lkuKbCyKdks52Xmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
