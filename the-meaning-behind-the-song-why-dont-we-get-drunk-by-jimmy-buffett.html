In his 1973 hit “Why Don’t We Get Drunk,” Buffett’s lyrics touch on the universal human desire to let go of inhibitions and indulge in alcohol. But there is more to the song than meets the ear.

But as the lyrics progress, it becomes clear that there is a deeper level of sexual tension and yearning behind Buffett’s words. He sings about feeling “like a swordfish, harpooned in midstream” and wanting to “talk dirty in Hawaiian.” The sensuous and playful imagery hints at a desire for intimate connection and release.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Temptation_of_Escape></span>The Temptation of Escape<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Buffett’s repeated refrain of “Why don’t we get drunk and screw?” might seem crass, but it reveals a deeper longing for escape and freedom. The song’s narrator is seeking release from the burdens of everyday life, whether it be a dead-end job, a rocky relationship, or a general sense of aimlessness. Drinking provides a temporary reprieve from these pressures, and the promise of “screwing” is a tantalizing prospect of letting go completely.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lyrical_Impressionism></span>Lyrical Impressionism<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the most fascinating aspects of “Why Don’t We Get Drunk” is the way Buffett uses impressionistic language to evoke moods and emotions. He sings about “the smell of the sea air” and “a sunset sinking low” to create a vivid sense of atmosphere. The lyrics are less concerned with storytelling and more interested in painting a picture of a specific moment in time. It’s a testament to Buffett’s songwriting skills that he can make such simple phrases feel so evocative.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Celebration_of_Friendship></span>A Celebration of Friendship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even as “Why Don’t We Get Drunk” explores darker themes of desire and escape, it ultimately celebrates the bonds of friendship. The song’s narrator is surrounded by a group of friends who are all equally eager to let loose and have a good time. The chorus becomes a rallying cry for camaraderie and shared experience. There is a sense of comfort and safety in being surrounded by like-minded people, and Buffett captures that feeling perfectly.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legacy_of_%E2%80%9CWhy_Dont_We_Get_Drunk%E2%80%9D></span>The Legacy of “Why Don’t We Get Drunk”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nearly 50 years after its initial release, “Why Don’t We Get Drunk” remains a beloved classic in Buffett’s catalog.
