The 392-page hardcover book is a compilation of Watermark’s previously published Small Town Series historical photo books on Lahaina, Wailuku and Upcountry — recognized by the American Association for State and Local History for excellence in the preservation and interpretation of regional history.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Exploring Historic Maui”</span> features hundreds of archival photos — with detailed narrative and locations keyed to walking maps — that together tell the island’s story from the whaling port of Old Lahaina to the sugar towns of Central Maui to the cow towns and corrals of Upcountry.</p><p>Lahaina-born Summer Kupau-Odo authored the book’s Lahaina section, sharing the old seaport’s history through images collected from local families’ photo albums and the Lahaina Restoration Foundation, among other sources. Here are Front Street in the 19th century, the Nagasako family in their candy store in 1921, a 1925 football team at Malu-‘ulu-o-Lele Park and the 1972 sinking of the sailing ship Carthaginian.</p><p>An alumna of Lahainaluna High School, Pepperdine University and the William S. Richardson School of Law, Kupau-Odo has spent her career in the legal profession.</p><p>The book’s Wailuku section, written and researched by George Engebretson, includes merchant and family photos never seen in print prior to publication of the Small Town Series, as well as photos from the Maui Historical Society, Bishop Museum and the Hawai’i State Archives. Among them: a turn-of-the-century trial in Maui’s first courthouse, the laying of the Good Shepherd Church cornerstone in 1910, Harry Kaya and his dog Queenie at the ‘Iao Theater snack shop and Hana-born opera singer Tandy Mackenzie posing with the Hawaiian Ladies Society in 1922.</p><p>A Honolulu native, Engebretson is publisher of Watermark Publishing and its subsidiary imprint, Legacy Isle Publishing.</p><p>Former Maui News reporter Jill Engledow contributed the section on Upcountry Maui and its vibrant history of sugar barons and shopkeepers, plantation families and paniolo. Upcountry images include Komoda Store circa 1916, the Molina Brothers Orchestra in Keahua Village in the mid-1930s, a 1937 Maui High School May Day Fete and post-tsunami devastation in Lower Paia in 1946.</p><p>Engledow has lived on Maui since the late 1960s and was a journalist at The Maui News for 18 years. A freelance writer for the past two decades, she is the author of several Maui-centric books and collaborations.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Exploring Historic Maui”</span> is available and priced at $22.95 in hardcover at bookstores and other retail outlets, from online booksellers, or direct from the publisher at www.bookshawaii.net.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News has compiled a list of countywide cancellations, closures and postponements due to coronavirus.
