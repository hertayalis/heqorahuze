Overall, this entire situation comes <a href=# rel>in the aftermath of a recent video of King Von</a> that has been making the rounds. As we reported, <a href=# class=text-word rel>King Von</a> was seen in a video where he spoke to police while behind bars. During the video, he claims to be gay so that he can get put into protective custody. Subsequently, people began questioning Von's sexuality. However, others noted that he was just trying to put himself in a better situation.</p><p>After this footage went viral, fans began posting <a href=# rel>alleged footage of King Lil Jay</a> while incarcerated. In the footage, reshared by No Jumper below, you can see a man sitting on a bench in the jail. From there, another man comes into the picture and sits on his lap. They also share a kiss before other inmates enter the scene. Many claimed that that this was Jay, although he has since issued a statement, denying this was him.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Man Says He Makes Money By Showing Chicago Tourists King Von Mural</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-lil-jay-speaks>King Lil Jay Speaks</h2></span><p>“Soon as y’all put dude up actually saying some gay s*** y’all would try to put me on there.
