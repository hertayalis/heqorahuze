His sinister machinations shaped the Skywalker saga: manipulating the events of the prequel trilogy from behind-the-scenes, ruling the galaxy in the original trilogy, and eventually executing an unlikely resurrection in the last of Disney’s sequels.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>But what about the man under the hood? Much of Palpatine’s life remains a mystery. We know he was born Sheev Palpatine on Naboo eighty-two years before the Battle of Yavin to a noble family, was taken on as a Sith apprentice by Darth Plagueis, and then pursued a career in galactic politics. But other than those skeletal plot details, everything else is hazy.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>But there’s an excellent idea being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed on r/StarWars</a> that’d clear away the fog from Palpatine’s story:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>How awesome would it be to have a TV show follow the rise, fall and inner workings of Darth Sideos/Emperor Palpatine?

This 2012 book reveals how Plagueis and Sidious’ relationship worked, as well as a rundown of his political machinations and how he trained Darth Maul. Palpatine is such a fantastic villain that we take grim satisfaction in watching him win, so seeing him outwit stuffy Galactic Senators with his Dark Side trickery would be a fun ride.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The only fly in the ointment would be finding someone to play young Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid is so closely associated with the part it’d be difficult for someone to fill his shoes, though replies suggest Tom Hiddleston, Matt Smith, or Jamie Campbell Bower would nail the part.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>But there are naysayers pointing out that this would be yet another Star Wars TV show with no stakes, as we know the end of the story.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>Then again, that didn’t stop people from enjoying Obi-Wan Kenobi so perhaps they could make it work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGarpJa%2FbsPAq6pmqKKavraxy2aqnqqZmsBusM6crKadnqm2r7OMrZ%2BeZaKewKZ5zp9knqWgmr%2BwvoypmKWokam2r7GMoqpmp55isrex0bJkn5meqHq4tdKhZKWho6l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
