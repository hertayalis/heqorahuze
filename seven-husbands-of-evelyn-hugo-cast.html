Other characters who will need to be cast for the film include all seven of Evelyn's husbands.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>if this is true im killing myself in front of taylor jenkins <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8YdhQ6j7Cf</a></p>â€” gio (@thislovve) <a href=#>March 30, 2023</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>On March 30, 2023, a Reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly leaked</a> the "short list" of actresses to receive the Netflix 7HEH script.

Fans have become so persistent in asking her if she is familiar with the project that she finally had to put her foot down.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chstains href=#>@chstains</a><p>well! ðŸ˜­ creds to honeyomen on instagram! <a title=jessicachastain href=#>#jessicachastain</a> <a title=thesevenhusbandsofevelynhugo href=#>#thesevenhusbandsofevelynhugo</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - celia" href=#>â™¬ original sound - celia</a></figure><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> video reposted from Instagram on April 18, 2023, featured a fan asking Jessica at the stage door of her theatrical play A Doll's House to sign her copy of the 7HEH book. Jessica replies, "I canâ€™t sign that, just because Iâ€™m not doing it," but agrees to take a selfie with the fan instead.</p><p>Then, due to the overwhelming fan response when the TikTok surfaced, Jessica <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">clarified her comments</a> on Twitter. She wrote, "Iâ€™ve been asked multiple times by fans, to sign books that Iâ€™m not attached to contractually. Because it feels wrong, and like I'm taking credit for someone elseâ€™s work, Iâ€™ll say I cant sign because Iâ€™m not doing it. That doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™ve read a bad script."</p><p>She added, "I know how excited many you are about adaptations. Please don't read too much into a video. There is no news about anything. Except that Iâ€™m onstage until June 10th. Hope to see you #ADollsHouse."</p><p>7HEH fans, don't worry! Hopefully soon, Netflix will release news about the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLK3sc1mn66rkpa7pb%2BMqJ1mnaaaubq6jKGsoKddmK60wA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
