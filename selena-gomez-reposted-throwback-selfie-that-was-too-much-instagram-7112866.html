And that goes for you too, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Selena Gomez</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Wednesday, the pop star reposted a once-deleted sultry selfie on Instagram — captioned, “I deleted this one time because I thought maybe it was too much but eh”— and we couldn't be happier that she did. While the archive image said so little, it spoke volumes, capturing Selena in a busty black strapless corset top paired with silver hoops. She playfully tousled her dark raven ponytail in one hand in the snap and sipped on a fruity cocktail in another. Selena’s pulled-back updo, smoky eye, and pink-lined lips perfectly mirrored the post’s alluring vibe.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Selena Gomez/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only did Selena give the people what they wanted with her mid-week selfie, but she also surpassed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kylie Jenner</a> to take the title of Instagram’s most-followed female (with a cool 381 million followers). Fans and friends flooded the comments to approve the return of the 2018 image, with best friend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Nicola Peltz Beckham</a> commenting, “UMMM GIVE THE FANS WHAT WE WANT 😍🔥 MOST STUNNING GIRL EVER!” Another added, “i hated when u did that,” and a third said, “Wow ! Thank god it’s back 🔥🔥."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of late, the actress has been posting quite frequently, but before that, she took a hiatus from social media. In a recent interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> for their annual Hollywood issue, she opened up about her anxiety from cruel comments on social media and how she survived it.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I never got the chance to go to an actual high school. The world was my high school for the longest time, and I started getting inundated with information that I didn’t want," she said to the publication. "I went through a hard time in a breakup and I didn’t want to see any of the [feedback] — not necessarily about the relationship, but the opinions of me versus [someone] else. There’d be thousands of really nice comments, but my mind goes straight to the mean one.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“People can call me ugly or stupid and I’m like, Whatever. But these people get detailed,” she continued. “They write paragraphs that are so specific and mean. I would constantly be crying. I constantly had anxiety … I couldn’t do it anymore. It was a waste of my time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The only thing I have on my phone is TikTok because I find it to be a little less hostile,” she said. “There are wonderful things about social media—connecting with fans, seeing how happy and excited they are and their stories. But usually that’s filtered through [for me now]. I created a system. Everything I do I send to my assistant who posts them. As far as comments, my team will put together a few things that are encouraging.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570p6jnqaRYrSwucSzZKudoKTAtbHDZquhqp%2Bsr6KvymaqnqSWnrJuwMeaq2avkah6tbvOZqSum5hitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYoRyfZFxbW8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
