The Axe Pokémon was first teased back in April 2023, and many players have since added the deadly monster to their party.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the elusive Pokémon, including how to catch them and how to best utilize their skills.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to get Kleavor in 'Pokémon GO'.</h2><p>The only way to get Kleavor in Pokémon GO is by completing a three-star Raid. Niantic was running an event on May 6 that saw Kleavor appearing in these Raids, although it has since concluded. That means that, as of now, it’s impossible to get Kleavor in Pokémon GO.</p><p>You can, of course, try to trade for Kleavor, although you’ll probably need to offer something enticing, as they’re one of the newest (and rarest) Pokémon in the game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The May 6 event also increased the likelihood of encountering a Shiny Kleavor, while also letting you earn five additional Raid Passes each day by spinning Gym Photo Discs.</p><p>It’s unclear if a similar event will return in the future, so be sure to keep your eyes glued to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Twitter account</a> for all the latest details. Niantic tends to run events like this without much advance notice, so it pays to stay active and alert for community updates.</p><p>Also, note that Scyther cannot evolve into Kleavor in Pokémon GO.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kleavor strengths and weaknesses in 'Pokémon GO'.</h2><p>When fighting against Kleavor in a Raid, you’ll likely need to party up with at least one or two other players. Three-star Raids aren’t the most challenging content in Pokémon GO, but having three Trainers battle against the monster gives you a better shot at success.</p><p>Kleavor is weak against Rock, Water, and Steel-type Pokémon, so try to bring one of them into battle. Specific Pokémon that counter Kleavor incredibly well include Blastoise, Slowbro, Steelix, and Aerodactyl.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Once you’ve added them to your party, you’ll have access to a wide variety of skills. This includes Air Slash, Quick Attack, Rock Slide, Stone Edge, and X-Scissor. Most players have found the combination of Rock Slide and Quick Attack to be the optimal build, offering both Rock-type and Normal-type damage.</p><p>Kleavor isn’t quite as powerful as other high-level Pokémon you can earn from Raids, but they’re still a solid addition to most teams — especially if you need a Rock-type attack. We’re not sure when it’ll make a triumphant return, so be on the lookout for updates from Niantic.</p><p>Pokémon GO is available for free on iOS and Android.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGK4rbHAr6arZaCkuKa5zqdkoKc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
