Bryan, who said he had tried everything he could to lose weight, thought it was time to try something new so he headed for the Spanish island and cut all communication with his family and friends to focus on himself.</p><p>For six months, he stuck to a strict calorie limit of 2,200 which he lowered to 1,750 for the final months, the <a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Daily Star</a> reports. He also exercised every day for around five hours.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p>The proud slimmer shared the details of his hard work to his Instagram account under @the.okeeffe.

Every day, I just tried to do one more rep, one more length, one more kilometre - whatever I could do to get 1% better."</p><p>Bryan revealed that he began his journey with gentle exercise such as walking for 90 minutes a day for the first fortnight. However, this soon became a tough five-hour a day routine as he introduced weight-lifting six days a week, swimming three times a week and running three times a week using the NHS Couch to 5K app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article28572581.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Image-2.jpg><p>His dedication meant that he was able to achieve a 2 and a half stone weight loss and was able to run a 5k in 34 minutes less than nine weeks after moving to Spain. Bryan said: "It was months of absolute suffering. The first three months I couldn't do anything other than eat, sleep and exercise.</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">Top news stories today</h3><p>"The rest of the time, I was lying on my sofa. I was hobbling just to try to go to the toilet. After the 4th month, my body got used to the constant pounding and it wasn't quite as bad."</p><p>Bryan kept his weight loss journey a secret, having only shared his goals to one friend, Colm Keenan. He called home twice a week to talk with his Dad who suffers from Alzheimer's disease when he knew his mother wouldn't be in their home.</p><p><b><i>Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter</i> </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i>here</i></b> </a><b><i>.</i></b></p><h2>READ NEXT:</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCrnZOkv6V6wqhlrqNfo7K4v46uomavn6e5pXnNnq6sZ52Wu26%2F066lrGWWlrqquNhmmJ%2Bslad6or7Roq2ippdif3mBlmtobW8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
