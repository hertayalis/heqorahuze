In this article, we will take a closer look at his life, legacy, and contributions to the religious community.</p><p>Dr. Charles Frazier Stanley was born on September 25th, 1932, in Dry Fork, Virginia. He graduated from the University of Richmond with a Bachelor of Arts degree and later earned a Master of Divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He also received several honorary doctoral degrees from various institutions.</p><p>For over five decades, Dr. Stanley served on the staff of First Baptist Atlanta. In 1971, he was named Senior Pastor, becoming the 16th pastor at the historic church, which was founded in 1848. Under his leadership, the church saw unprecedented growth.</p><p>In 1997, FBA moved from its Midtown Atlanta location on Peachtree Street to the former Avon property in Dunwoody to accommodate its diverse membership of more than 15,000 from all over the metro area.</p><p>Dr. Stanley was a pioneer in religious broadcasting, and in 1977, he founded In Touch Ministries. His goal was to “get the truth of the Gospel to as many people as possible.”</p><p>His sermons, podcasts, and devotionals have been seen or heard in more than 115 million homes per week in over 126 countries worldwide. At the time of his death, Dr. Stanley could be heard in every nation on Earth via radio, shortwave, or television broadcasts.</p><p>In the United States, the In Touch television program could be seen on 204 stations and seven satellite networks, and the In Touch radio program could be heard on 458 stations and via shortwave radio.</p><p>In 1988, he was inducted into the National Religious Broadcasters Hall of Fame. As an author, he wrote more than 60 books, including several New York Times bestsellers.</p><p>He also served for two terms as the president of the Southern Baptist Convention in the 1980s.</p><p>Dr. Stanley’s favorite hobby was nature photography, and the walls of the In Touch studios are adorned with many of his photos.</p><p>In fact, one of his pictures, given as a gift to the late Reverend Billy Graham, was hanging on the wall in Graham’s bedroom at the time of his death.</p><h2>Dr Charles Stanley Wife and children</h2><p>Dr. Stanley is survived by his two children, his daughter Becky and son Andy, who is the founder and senior pastor at Northpoint Ministries.</p><p>Andy called his dad a role model for pastors, stating, “Not just how to preach or how to build a church. But how to get to a finish line with integrity and to be able to look back and be proud of everything that came before, and unfortunately that’s increasingly rare.”</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
