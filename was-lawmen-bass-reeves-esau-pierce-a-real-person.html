He’s a creep. History is full of creeps. Bass Reeves is based (very, very loosely) on history. It’s nice to know how invested you should be in disliking a bad guy if you don’t want to seem like a creep yourself – folks don’t mind if you say “I love the Joker in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Knight</a>,” but tell them “I really relate to that Bundy looker in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,” and your social calendar will open right up.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>And so, for the sake of context in your future television viewing, no. Esau Pierce was not a real person.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=708 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>You’d be forgiven for thinking that he might be. There is, after all, something terribly familiar about the man, especially in a Western setting. He’s played by Barry Pepper, an actor with what passes for a Wild West pedigree in this cowboy-light era. Pepper can be seen looking every bit as conniving and road-weary in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2010’s True Grit</a>, and as a corrupt 19th century politician in the 2013 cinematic… experience The Lone Ranger. He was also in 2016’s Monster Trucks as a sheriff, which barely relates to all of this, it’s just a movie that seems to have fallen through the cracks of the collective cultural psyche in a really frightening way. Monster Trucks exists. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It cost $125 million to make</a>.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>There are aspects of Esau Pierce that can be traced back to the real world. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lawmen: Bass Reeves</a> portrays the character as a member of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, an actual Confederate regiment out of what would&nbsp; eventually become Oklahoma. They lost a lot of battles, took part in a lot of events with the word “massacre” in the title, and they were the last southern regiment to surrender in an official capacity. But they never counted a corrupt lawman named Esau Pierce among their number.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4rdJmo5qvnZq7bq7ArKpmqpWaw6a%2FjJ6qmq1dpbamvsKeZJplopqurXnPnqmsp55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
