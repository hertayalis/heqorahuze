Well, I say it’s about time that we properly appreciate them. So, if you’re looking to get to know this studio’s projects a little bit more, here is a list of the most delightful animated shows it has been involved in.</p><h2 id=h-lookism-2022 data-injectable=false>Lookism (2022)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix’s Lookism</a> offers an insightful look into beauty standards by packaging it in an entertaining fantasy series.

The series offers us a look at what its fantasy world looks like 70 years after its predecessor, by following Korra as she finds her own path as the new Avatar. If you were impressed by Aang’s story, streaming Korra’s on Netflix will likely fill the void it left behind.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Harley Quinn (2019-present)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>For fans of adult dark and adult comedy, Harley Quinn is a must.

Or at least, we’ve all heard it mentioned at some point in our lives. Well, this one is a Netflix reboot, following five Earthlings who stumble upon a giant, robotic lion and see their lives changed. Thrown into the middle of an alien war, they swear to protect the universe from the Galra Empire but to accomplish that, they must first reunite all five lions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kippo and the Age of Wonderbeats (2020)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>Set in a future where humans have been forced into underground cities by the rise of anthropomorphic creatures, this is a show for fans of adventure, sci-fi, and action.

With the Freemans at the center, the series portrays the conflicts that arise from the discrepancies between this black American family and the other residents of Woodcrest suburbs, a predominantly white area. If you’re into satire and comedy that deals with such issues, head over to Max or Adult Swim.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Guardians of the Galaxy (2015-2019)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Before you ask: no, this isn’t part of the MCU timeline, but it’s definitely worth a watch.

Based on a video game, the animated Netflix series is everything that fantasy aficionados can hope for, following a Davion, a dragon slayer who gets his soul fused with a creature of that very same species. Now, he sets out on a quest to defeat the demon Terrorblade, becoming part of something much bigger than he ever anticipated.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Young Justice (2010-2022)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=false>If you’re hoping for a faithful adaptation of the Young Justice comics, this isn’t it, sorry.
