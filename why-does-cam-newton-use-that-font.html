Namely, that he uses a very distinct font on all of his posts. Like, really distinct.

Some fans have called his font choice childish or just straight-up wacky. While we agree that it certainly looks a bit out of place while scrolling through a typical Instagram feed, we also think that it could actually be a good thing! Cam seems to think so, too.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2017 interview</u></a>, Cam Newton spoke briefly about why he uses the cryptic font on his social media posts. “One thing it makes you do is it makes you focus on what I’m saying,” he said. He spoke again briefly about his characteristic font choice in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2019,</u></a> saying, “For me, it’s being able to express yourself and being uniquely you. For me, we all are different, and we all possess things that make us different than the next person, from spelling, typing, or even speaking.” Fair enough!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=lt dir=ltr>ŪÑDĒR THĒ ŠŪÑ THĒ RÄČĒ ÏŠ ÑØT GÏVĒÑ TØ THĒ Š₩ÏFT, ñør thë bâttłë tø thë štrøñg, ÑØR ßRĒÄD TØ THĒ ₩ÏŠĒ, ñør wëâłth tø thë ïñtëłłïgëñt, ÑØR ŠŪČČĒŠŠ TØ THĒ ŠKÏŁŁFŪŁ, bût tïmë âñd čhâñčë gøvërñ âłł.

"There’s something about those characters [that Cam uses] that you’re actually so curious and caught off-guard, that you take the time to really decipher it, and in a weird way, you’re actually reading it more in-depth.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There’s no denying that it takes slightly longer to decipher Cam’s posts. These days, when countless brands are vying for our attention on social media and elsewhere, any kind of trick that gets people’s eyes to linger slightly longer than usual is actually pretty priceless — should we start publishing our articles using that font? (Don’t worry, we won’t.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Want to post like Cam Newton? You can!</h2><p>If you find yourself wishing you could write similarly enigmatic captions on social media, you should look into the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>I Post My Way app</u></a>, which was “inspired and envisioned” by Cam’s own posts. It’s a special keyboard that allows users to either convert text or create custom keys to, well, post their own way.&nbsp;</p><p>That certainly seems like the best way to change up the way you write, at least if you don’t want to spend 15 minutes writing each caption. We have to wonder how long it takes Cam to write his posts these days! Presumably, he’s used to taking whatever extra steps it might require to create a caption in his preferred font. And according to his Instagram bio, he’s not planning on changing things up anytime soon. It says (in his particular font, obvs) “I’m not changing the way I type, get over it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlk5a6brrEsKuopl2qwKZ506GYrWWWpLu1</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
