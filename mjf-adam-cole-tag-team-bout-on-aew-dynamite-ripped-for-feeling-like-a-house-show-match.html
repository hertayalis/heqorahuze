Maxwell is now the AEW World Champion and that further raises his stock every single week. MJF is tag partners with Adam Cole and has been trying to be very chummy with him. Now it appears MJF and Adam Cole’s most recent match on AEW Dynamite has been ripped for feeling like a house show match.</p><p>Adam Cole and MJF had a stellar match a few weeks ago on AEW Dynamite. Instead of getting a rematch, AEW decided best that they would become tag team partners for the blind tag team tournament.</p><p>As seen on this week’s episode of AEW Dynamite, MJF and Adam Cole squared off against Big Bill and Brian Cage in the semi-finals of the AEW blind eliminator tag team tournament.</p><p>The match had a lot of comedic elements in it, as the match largely focused on MJF’s babyface-like antics. In the end, MJF and Adam Cole won the match and celebrated in a big way.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Busted Open Radio</a>, WWE Hall Of Famer Bully Ray talked about the aforementioned tag team match. Ray criticized the match for being too comedic and feeling like a house show match instead of something serious.</p><p>“Overall, I thought last night’s show was good,” Bully said. “There were a lot of fun things on the show, but there were a couple of things that, to me, did not make sense. It’s not even the refereeing stuff, it’s [the] psychology of a match. It’s actually the MJF-Adam Cole match</p><p>So it is supposed to be a serious match, right?” Bully asked. “Because it is part of a tournament that obviously MJF wants to win real bad, because MJF and Cole winning helps lure Cole in a lot more with MJF. … I felt that there should have been a bit more … seriousness on the front end. Right off the bat, we get MJF going in for the body slam, and then really doing that hokey sell of his back. I believed that the first half of the match felt like a house show match to me.</p><p>AEW is not a big man company,” Bully stated. “Tony Khan does not invest in big men, period. End of sentence. His company, his choice to do so. Every once in a while, yes, a … big man gets a little taste of something, but they don’t really focus on anybody. If it’s up to me, I’m focusing on Powerhouse Hobbs. I’m putting as much shine and spotlight on Powerhouse Hobbs as I am Moxley or CM Punk. Because he is an up-and-coming talent, [he] looks the part, is doing a better job speaking the part.”</p><p>MJF and Adam Cole will be sqauring off against Daniel Garcia and Sammy Guevara on in the finals of the tournament. The winner will go on to challenge FTR for the AEW World Tag Team Titles on the July 29th edition of AEW Collision. We’ll have to wait and see if MJF and Adam Cole will end up winning the match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on this story?
