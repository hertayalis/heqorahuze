That takes nothing away from him as an actor, however, as he always does a great job, but it’s hard to escape the feeling that he’s been typecast as General Sam Lane in <a href=#><strong>Supergirl</strong></a>.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>There’s been talk for a while now of the character appearing in the series when it debuts this Fall, and this version of Lane is described as a powerful military lifer and an overprotective father to both Lucy Lane and her sister, Lois. His arrival in National City stirs up trouble for Supergirl when he enlists her in a dangerous government initiative.</p>[zergpaid]<p data-characters=184 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>In the comics, the General has frequently been portrayed as something of an antagonist to Superman, but it sounds like he may have moved past that by the time we meet him in <strong>Supergirl</strong>.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Sam is the second Lane to be added to the series in recent weeks, as Jenna Dewan Tatum was cast as Lucy Lane a little earlier this year. Whether or not Lois is going to show up at some point remains to be seen, but it does appear as if core Superman characters like that may be off limits because of the movies. Time will tell, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3youMSnpWaln6fAqbvWnqlmqJyWxm6zxKecq5mcYsCiuYylmKedXajCsbHRoKCrpF2pw26%2FxKugnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
