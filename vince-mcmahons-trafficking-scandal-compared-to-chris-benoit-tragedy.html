Interestingly enough, his scandal has now been compared to Chris Benoit’s tragedy as well.</p><p>On the other hand, Chris Benoit was one of the best pro wrestlers to have ever stepped foot inside the squared circle, but the tragic way his life ended soured any legacy he left in the ring. After all, he killed his wife and child before committing suicide in 2007 – something that no one can forgive.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Story Time with Dutch Mantell</a>, Dutch Mantell discussed the possibility of WWE erasing Vince McMahon from its history, similar to what was done with Chris Benoit.</p><p>Dutch Mantell stated that WWE could definitely do the same thing to Vince McMahon that they did to Chris Benoit, but added that McMahon’s scandal is bigger than Benoit’s tragedy.</p><p>“They can, really. For years and years and years, he [Vince McMahon] was all over it [WWE television], so I don’t know how they could erase him. I mean, they could, but they’d have to get somebody to say a voiceover. They’d have to get that erased, and it’d be a lot of trouble. This is the biggest story I think wrestling has had ever. I don’t think the Chris Benoit story was this big.”</p><p><a href=#>WWE is also reportedly attempting to remove Vince McMahon from the WWE 2K24</a>&nbsp;video game and it is unlikely fans will see him back in WWE, which might be the best course of order now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of this story?
