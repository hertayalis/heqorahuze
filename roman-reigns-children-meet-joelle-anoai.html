He is a member of the legendary Anoa’i wrestling family, which includes Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Yokozuna, and Rikishi.</p><p>Reigns attended Escambia High School in Pensacola, where he played football as a defensive tackle. He later attended Georgia Institute of Technology, where he played for the Yellow Jackets football team. After college, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent but was cut from the team in 2007.</p><p>In 2010, Reigns signed a developmental contract with WWE and was assigned to their developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling. He made his WWE debut in 2012 as a member of The Shield, a faction that also included Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins. The Shield quickly became one of the most popular and dominant groups in WWE, winning numerous championships and feuding with some of the biggest names in the company.</p><p>Reigns made his singles debut in 2014 and quickly became one of the top stars in WWE. He won his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2015 and has gone on to win the championship four more times, as well as numerous other titles. He has also main-evented multiple WrestleManias, WWE’s biggest annual event.</p><p>In addition to his success in WWE, Reigns has also pursued acting. He has appeared in several films, including “Hobbs & Shaw” (2019) and “The Wrong Missy” (2020). He has also made appearances on TV shows, including “Psych” and “Total Divas.”</p><p>Reigns’ in-ring style is characterized by his power and athleticism. He is known for his signature spear, which he uses to devastating effect, as well as his Superman Punch and his submission finisher, the Guillotine Choke. He is also known for his cocky, confident persona and his ability to get under the skin of his opponents.</p><p>Reigns’ personal life has not been without its challenges. In 2018, he announced that he was taking time off from WWE to undergo treatment for leukemia, a disease he had previously battled and gone into remission from. He returned to WWE in 2019 and has since used his platform to raise awareness and funds for cancer research and support.</p><p>In 2020, Reigns made a stunning return to WWE, aligning himself with Paul Heyman and adopting a new, more ruthless character. Dubbed the “Tribal Chief,” Reigns has dominated the WWE landscape since his return, winning the Universal Championship and feuding with some of the top stars in the company.</p><p>Despite his success in WWE and his burgeoning acting career, Reigns remains committed to his family and his roots in the Anoa’i wrestling dynasty. He is married and has five children, and he has often spoken about the importance of family and tradition in his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Roman Reigns Children: Meet Joelle Anoa’i</h2><p>Roman Reigns has five children.

He and his wife welcomed twin boys, named Akira and Taja, in 2016, and their fourth child, a son named Kaia, and fifth child, a son named Jacob, are also twins and they were born in 2020.</p><p>Reigns is known for being a very private person when it comes to his personal life, and he has not shared many details about his children or family in public. However, he has spoken about the importance of family and his commitment to being a good husband and father in interviews and on social media.</p><p>In one interview, Reigns talked about how becoming a father has changed his perspective on life and his career.
