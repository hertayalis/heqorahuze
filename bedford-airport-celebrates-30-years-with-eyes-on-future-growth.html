The current one reaching its 30-year-milestone, with a celebration on Thursday.</p><p>“Thirty years under our belt means thirty more ahead. We’ve got the space. We got the track record. We got the history now, to say we can do it here in Bedford.” says C.F.O. for Bun Air Corporation, Jennifer DeLong.</p><p>Officials tell me they are thrilled with the progress they’ve seen over the years, and say the properties next to the airport give more room for expansion and business in and out of Bedford county.</p><p>“Our industrial parks are full. And that's great news for our economic development department here with the county.” says Thomas McInroy, Chairman for the Bedford County Airport Authority.</p><p>Officials say the previous airports were not big enough, with little room to expand. Corporate leaders, lawmakers, and commissioners say the current one has served the community well.</p><p>“We’ve come a long ways in thirty years. From what they were saying, I remember when it was down the street, when there was just the little Cessna airplanes flying in and out.” Mike stiles, with the Bedford county commissioners says.</p><p>“I prepared a citation from the senate, across the desk of the senate floor to honor their thirty years, this is thirty years of dedication to the community.” says Sen. Pat Stefano, (R) 32nd District.</p><p>Leaders also say the hurdles they faced in the past three decades, including overall hiring, have prepared them for the next thirty years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfl7Klss6rm2aZmae9sL7TZpqepJWXv6LAxKxkbGhdrrKivtJmrqKsmGKyurHSZqanZZaqwba%2BxGaeq6enqbU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
