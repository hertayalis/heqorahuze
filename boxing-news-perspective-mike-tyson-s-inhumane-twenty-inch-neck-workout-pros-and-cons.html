His ferocious and no-nonsense approach to boxing evoked fear among the opponents. Every time the American stepped into the ring, he brought violence and utter disregard for defensive boxing. However, his stellar rise was not limited to his explosive power but also his ability to absorb punches and a strong chin, especially his 20-inch neck.</span></p><p><span>The visuals of ‘Kid Dynamite’ walking to the boxing ring in a towel-cut terrified many. A similar case can be made for his insanely thick neck, which puzzled many. The former heavyweight champion is a freak of nature, partly attributed to his genetics and partly to his intense training. Undoubtedly, genetics plays an important role in determining body structure, resulting in a larger neck circumference. But Tyson’s grueling training regime most probably contributed to his steel-esque, powerful neck muscles.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Mike Tyson: The brutal neck workout</span></h2><p><span>At 18, Mike Tyson boasted an unusual 20-inch neck. Labeled a ‘Man-Child,’ he used to spar with heavyweights beyond his age, and to protect himself, he developed a strong and thick neck. The legendary </span><strong><span>Cus D’Amato</span></strong><span>&nbsp;then put him through some brutal neck exercises, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>the most prominent of which were ‘neck bridges.’</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago0302476437h.jpg><p><span>The exacting exercise involved Tyson lying on his back and using his neck muscles to lift his head and upper body to rock back and forth. Despite looking dangerous, painful, and unpleasant to the eyes, this exercise makes one’s neck stronger. This was the reason the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>legendary boxer’s routine included neck bridges for 30 minutes.</a></span></p><p><span>Neck bridges are a tedious procedure that runs a high risk of sustaining injury if attempted wrongly. The risks are such that certain gyms have banned it. Fitness professionals detest it and forbid its practice, as it can result in various injuries and damage to the cervical spine. However, ‘Iron Mike’ perfected it to the core, which then helped him endure the blunt punches of the likes of&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong><span>Evander Holyfield</span></strong></a><span>.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>20-inch neck: Taking a mean punch to the face</span></h2><p><span>Mike Tyson notably began his professional career as an 18-year-old in March 1985, and within two years, he found himself at the top of the heavyweight division’s food chain. His neck was <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>significantly thicker than any heavyweight</a>, and it allowed him to take a punch. With an increased thickness of the neck, the endurance for pain also soared.</span></p><p><span>He would take the punch to his chin and unload more powerful ones in return. In addition, a thicker neck also reduces the chances of a concussion and head injuries, especially in heavyweight boxing, where boxers weigh over 200 pounds. Likewise, it can lessen whiplash and help them stay on their feet for a longer time.</span></p><p><span>While Tyson popularized it in the 80s and 90s, many contemporary boxing coaches tend to overlook it. Except for&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong><span>Anthony Joshua</span></strong></a><span>, who engages in a method called ‘Critical Neck Training,’ very few boxers pay heed to strengthening their necks. And they always look back at Mike Tyson and what neck bridges did to his career.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Neck hazards and an untimely end to a career</span></h2><p><span>In 2013, Mike Tyson stunned the public when he donned a neck brace at a Las Vegas charity auction. The reason? He had inserted titanium pins to support his neck due to an old spinal injury resurfacing and causing him pain. Despite boasting an illustrious resume, his career could have run a bit longer if his spinal injuries, caused by neck bridges, hadn’t derailed it.</span></p><p><span>Tyson even opened up about his neck exercises on The Joe Rogan Experience, which resulted in agonizing pain. His neck exercises left him with long-lasting damage, which continues to haunt him. Tyson expressed,&nbsp;</span><span>“You remember when I used to do those moves on my head? The bridges.”</span></p><p><span>“They destroyed me, yeah. I would do them for three minutes, stop a minute, do it for three minutes. Then I’d do it for five, six, or eight rounds,”&nbsp;</span><span>he added later.</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-i-wanted-to-kick-somebody-in-the-head-amidst-four-hundred-fifty-thousand-lawsuit-by-jetblue-passenger-mike-tyson-details-how-discipline-helps-dealing-with-someone-you-hate?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1124725496.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">“I Wanted to Kick Somebody in the Head”: Amidst $450,000 Lawsuit by Jetblue Passenger, Mike Tyson Details How Discipline Helps Dealing With Someone You Hate</p></a><p><span>While Tyson’s 20-inch neck helped him achieve excellence, it also unleashed unbearable pain and took away a portion of his retired life.
