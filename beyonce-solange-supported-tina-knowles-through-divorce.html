They were my balm," said Knowles-Lawson. "They let me feel sorry for myself for a short period of time, and then they were like, 'Mama, you're a bad girl.' I won't use the word that they gave me but … they were like, 'You've got so much going, you shouldn't be feeling like life is over for you,' that 'God has something for you.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following her divorce, Knowles-Lawson went on to marry actor Richard Lawson in 2015 while her ex-husband went on to marry model Gena Avery in 2013. Since then, Knowles-Lawson has stated how her daughters have transformed into maternal figures themselves and often check in with her in a motherly manner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Having my girls...my three girls... has been the biggest blessing in my whole entire life. They are always there for me and the roles—isn't it interesting how the roles change? I've been the mama, but now sometimes they're my mom," continued Knowles-Lawson, who also is the stepmother to actress Bianca Lawson. "It's just funny how the roles change, and they became my mom and I became the child. That's the great thing about having women. I'm still their mother, and I still want to be able to check them when I need to, but they check me too. So it's a good thing."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
