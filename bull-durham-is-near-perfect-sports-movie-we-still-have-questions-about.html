Susan Sarandon also stars as Annie Savoy, a lifelong baseball groupie who romances and also imparts wisdom to LaLoosh, although Crash ultimately gets the girl in the end.</p><p>“Bull Durham” — ranked the No.5 sports movie all time by the American Film Institute — even might have earned our first perfect rating in this series. But like many sports flicks, there are a few plot points that only would happen through the Hollywood lens.</p><p>For instance, we are told that LaLoosh strikes out 18 and walks 18 — both league records! — in his first professional start, which would be a minimum of 126 pitches and likely closer to 200. No chance, even then.</p><p>Also, after overcoming several poor starts, under Crash’s and Annie’s tutelage Nuke finally wins a few games and immediately gets the call to make the direct jump from Single-A to the majors?</p><p>As Davis would advise, “Don’t think. It can only hurt the ballclub.”</p><p><strong>Quote of Note:</strong> “OK, well, candlesticks always make a nice gift, and maybe you could find out where she’s registered and maybe a place-setting or a silverware pattern. OK, let’s get two!” — pitching coach Larry Hockett (Robert Wuhl), discussing the upcoming wedding of one of the players during a meeting on the mound.</p><p><strong>Botte Blows:</strong> 4.7 of 5</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j21maW5fl8KtuIydrKugkaJ6qr%2BMp5yaql2lsrOyxJyrZqugpL%2B1v4ympq%2BhlWLEpnnSraClpF2drrexjKqsnquknryvv4yamaitpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
