Though we don't often act like it, as reviewers we need to assume that the people designing these products know what they're doing and are smarter than we are, and they're aware of the trade-offs being made. Yet my experiences with Lian Li cases often leave me baffled in some respects, and while I like the PC-TU100 for specific tasks, I feel like once again they've missed the boat.</p><p>If you like all-aluminum finishes, you're already shopping Lian Li, and the PC-TU100 won't disappoint. Owing to the case's small stature, the aluminum used feels at least a little more sturdy than it typically does even if it's prone to picking up fingerprints and potentially being scuffed. The symmetrical design, the rounded corners, and the handle are actually all attractive choices, though, and I like the way the side panels just pop out. I also appreciate how trimmed down this design is compared to the PC-TU200 that preceded it. Component support is forward-thinking here; Lian Li was right to only support the smallest form factors available, as it cuts down on case volume while still providing a reasonable number of options.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6982/Small%20(7%20of%207).jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Assembly was about as easy as it was going to get for a case this small and was a welcome change of pace, but unfortunately that isn't where the buck stops. When we get to actual performance, the PC-TU100 is woefully lacking in both thermals and acoustics. I don't think Lian Li intended any kind of bait and switch with the PC-TU100, but that handle and the small form factor are writing checks that the performance of the case can't cash. The front intake fan seems to be both inefficient and poorly placed, and it's the only cooling the case has.</p><p>Could you build a LAN machine using the PC-TU100? Probably. Would I recommend it? Absolutely not. The handle is convenient but if you want a case you can easily carry from party to party, the BitFenix Prodigy is in almost every way a superior choice. Lian Li's case is smaller and lighter, but its performance is so poor that you won't be able to put a particularly robust video card inside it without risking a tremendous amount of noise and cooking your SSD. I can see why the TU100 is $109 and I can see where the money is going, but the Prodigy allows for more powerful and quieter builds at $79. More attractive alternatives to the TU100 abound: the SilverStone Sugo SG08 may be $199 but it comes with a power supply and it's far more efficient. The Sugo SG05 can be had with a power supply for less than $150 as well, and is also a better performer. Even the Fractal Design Node 304 beats the TU100, and it does so at $20 less.</p><p>This could've been a really good case. The form factor has forced Lian Li to start stripping things down and stripping away complexity, but the thermal design is a total bust. I know Lian Li can do better than this, but unless you have a specific usage scenario that the PC-TU100 would be ideal for, warts and all, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN6hJFoo6KZnmK5qnnPnKuuaWBleq61zaKgrbBdmK60sYyrnK%2Bhlax8dw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
