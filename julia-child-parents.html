Spending time in the kitchen was something Julia was incredibly passionate about. Now, HBO’s new show, Julia, has a lot of people curious to know about the culinary icon's family life.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women’s History</a>, her father, John McWilliams Jr., was a banker and landowner, and her mother, Julia Carolyn Weston, was the heiress to the Massachusetts Weston Paper Company fortune. John cared a lot about instilling morals and values into the minds of his children, while Julia took education very seriously.</p><p>Julia attended the boarding school Katherine Branson School for Girls, where she studied subjects like history, mathematics, French, and Latin. During her time there, she also participated in sports like basketball, swimming, and tennis. Julia followed in her mother's academic footsteps when she chose to attend Smith College in Massachusetts. She graduated in 1934.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about Julia Child's other family members?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Famous People</a>, Julia was the oldest of three siblings in her household. She had a younger brother, John McWilliams III, and a younger sister, Dorothy Cousins. As far as Julia's decision to have a family of her own goes, she was married to Paul Cushing Child from 1946 until 1994, when he passed away.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Find a Grave</a>, Paul was considered an artistic and worldly man who was intelligent and self-educated.

The couple never ended up having any kids because they were unable to conceive. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Town & Country Mag</a>, Julia’s grandnephew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Prud’homme</a> weighed in on the situation in a novel titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The French Chef in America.</a></p><p>He wrote that Julia “grew wistful about not having a child and grandchild… yet acknowledged that had she conceived she would’ve devoted her energy to her children and would not have had a career that she did."
