In addition to her father being arrested, Minerva Mirabal and her mother were taken into police custody after the party. <a href=#>The Real DR</a> reports they were held hostage at Hotel Nacional, where police ferried Minerva back and forth to interrogations offsite until eventually she and her mother were released.</p><p dir=ltr>Later, sometime in the 1950s, Minerva and her parents were arrested yet again. This time police held them in the Hotel Presidente, and her father was detained at Fortress Ozama. The charge was frivolous, as authorities claimed Minerva did not buy a book about Rafael Trujillo. When they were released weeks later, her father died as a result of ill health from being harassed and imprisoned.</p><p dir=ltr>Even after getting married and starting a family, Minerva continued to be incarcerated. According to her daughter, Minou&nbsp;Tavarez Mirabal, Minerva and her husband, also an activist, were frequently jailed simultaneously. They would often send letters back and forth between their prison cells, as per <a href=#>BBC</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Following the formation of their "Movement of the Fourteenth of June" group, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Vintage News</a> reports sisters Minerva Mirabal and Maria Teresa Mirabal, along with their husbands, were rounded up one by one and sent to La Victoria Penitentiary in the capital. By this point, Trujillo had lost face with the international community. Under pressure from the Organization of American States, only the sisters were released in a bid to improve his public image.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElmpvbGlfqbWmedOrmKChk2KutL%2FArKqippGptrC6jKidZqyYmnqutdGamZqkXai2tMDEq6pmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
