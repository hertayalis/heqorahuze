"They were inseparable," Feig told <a href=#>Parade</a>&nbsp;about the stars' relationship on set â€” and even afterwards.&nbsp;"Normally after movies, those friendships go away... Theirs blossomed."</p><p>This friendship was a surprising development considering how McCarthy and Bullock weren't even friends prior to filming. They had mutual friends, sure, but they had never met each other before. "When people found out we were doing this thing, I got between 12 and 15 calls saying, 'You're about to meet the greatest girl in the world,'" McCarthy told <a href=#>People</a> of finding out she was about to work with the "Miss Congeniality" actor. During their first encounter, she confessed to being a nervous wreck. "I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to get a call from Sandra Bullock!' And I was still saying first and last name, I could only say 'Sandra Bullock,'" the star shared.</p><p>The two ended up hitting it off, and the rest, as they say, is history. "It was ridiculous. It was so fun every day. We are torturing each other, laughing at the same time," McCarthy told <a href=#>"Good Morning America"</a>&nbsp;of filming "The Heat" with Bullock. "She's so funny and so nice that every day was kind of a real treat." Speaking of treats, per Parade, the stars have even gone trick-or-treating together with their young children, who often play with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xjaIJ3e8CrnGallaG2tL%2FAZqScm5GnwanFjJqlnWWjlrulvsBmma6knKSwrHnFq6CeppSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
