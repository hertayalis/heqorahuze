Early on, he mixed with many other British musicians from the era. In his 2010 chat with Alice Cooper, Beck recalled seeing a psychedelic band just getting their start at that point — none other than Pink Floyd (via <a href=#>YouTube</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>In that same interview, Beck recalled the out-there lighting effects Pink Floyd was known to perform with. It wasn't until many years later — about a week before the Cooper interview, in fact — that Beck realized that Pink Floyd was at that point interested in joining forces with the young guitarist. Speaking with Cooper, Beck said, "I never would have thought they would have given me the light of day."</p><p>In 1968, founding Pink Floyd member Syd Barrett had just recently left the group. In 2009, long-time Pink Floyd member David Gilmour (pictured), who joined Pink Floyd a short time before Barrett left, commented on Beck's near Pink Floyd membership in <a href=#>MOJO</a> magazine.
