Mandy worked with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper on the film Silver Linings Playbook. She also choreographed the amazing numbers in La La Land, starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. &nbsp;</p><p>“I feel like La La Land is the Super Bowl of your career. For this to happen for dance, for it to happen for me, and choreography, I mean, this is huge, huge, huge. I might need to hang up these shoes after this,” she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denver Post</u></a> about her career highlight. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Choreographer Mandy Moore was a judge on Dancing With the Stars: Juniors.</h2><p>Before becoming a household name, Mandy started off as an assistant on Season 1 of SYTYCD. From there, she grew to a choreographer, then to a creative producer in Season 14.&nbsp;</p><p>"So You Think You Can Dance was one of my first jobs, so it feels like home. I love the chaos of live television; as soon as one show is over you're on to the next," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dance Magazine</a> about why she returns to the show each season.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With a stacked resume, the 43-year-old became a judge, alongside Valentin Chmerkovskiy and Adam Rippon on the series premiere of DWTS: Juniors. The choreographer was praised for her feedback to the young contestants, but working with kids is something that is very familiar to Mandy. She teaches at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dance convention JUMP</a>, which trains kids in every style. &nbsp;</p><p>While she loves choreographing a big stage routine, she revealed to Dance Magazine that working in a dance studio teaching is where she still feels “most comfortable” and continues to be her “main focus.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Check out Mandy Moore on Instagram!</h2><p>If you love all things dance, you should follow the choreographer (not the actress) on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. Mandy regularly promotes material and shows fans what she is working on. She’ll even sometimes share behind-the-scene pics from rehearsals.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, she’s posted snapshots from her work on So You Think You Can Dance. My inside voice: Woah, k...these Katz are doing it! My outside voice: K, from the top... A-5-6-7-8!!! Loving these dancers!” she captioned a picture of herself from the Fox series.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Dancing With the Stars on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vsNhmpKinopp6pLTOq5yon6KWvamx0WabsKyj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
